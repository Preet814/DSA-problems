Problem : Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
          A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
          Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
          Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have 
          a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
          
          Example 1:
          Input: s = "the sky is blue"
          Output: "blue is sky the"

Solution :
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        int n=s.length();
        int left=0,right=0,i=0;
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());
        while(i<n){
            while(i<n && s[i]==' ')
                i++;
            if(i==n)
                break;
            while(i<n && s[i]!=' '){
                s[right++]=s[i++];
            }
            reverse(s.begin()+left,s.begin()+right);
            s[right++]=' ';
            left=right;
            i++;
        }
        s.resize(right-1);
        return s;
    }
    
};
