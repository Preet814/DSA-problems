Problem : You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both 
          arrays are of length n.
          For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.
          Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.
          
          Example 1:
          Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
          Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
          Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.

Solution : 

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> sortPeople(vector<string>& names, vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<pair<int,int>> arr;
        for(int i=0;i<heights.size();i++){
            arr.push_back({heights[i],i});
        }
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end(),greater());
        vector<string> ans;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            auto temp=arr[i];
            ans.push_back(names[temp.second]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
